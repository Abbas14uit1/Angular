1. With all files multiple directories run drive_play_check.py to find errors within files
Or if files are all in a single base bath uncomment the single directory checker and run the drive play checker

Note: The last column of the log file is called "driveindex_number". If this is "FALSE" for a given game, it is fatal and will cause the batch processing to fail.

This is triggered when there are no drives and the plays have a missing drive index. 
For example:

"1,1,2"
"3,1,3"

This only happens for a few files but is a very hard error to catch manually. Need to add functionality in the batch processing file to find the missing drive index and renumber the rest of the plays.

Also need to remove files with "BAD" xml and "NOTGAME" flags in the log files

Also some teams are incorrectly named and do not have a TEAM ID. For example, "Alabama" is listed as "Alabama Crimson Tide" which is why the hash lookup in the batch processing fails to add a TEAM ID. Need to fix the TEAM ID before uploading.

2. Once errors in files have been fixed run batch_rename_in_place.py to rename all game files 
sorted by game date and to put all files in a single directory 

dir_name is the directory in which the original files are located
dest_dir is the directory in which all the files will be placed in a single direcot

are correct and point to valid directories. Also make sure dest_dir is empty before running

3. To process files run batch_add_drive_play.py to add drives to files that are missing them,
and to add fake plays and drives to files as well.

dir_name is the directory of the files to be processed. Note that all files should be located in the base path of the directory
with no sub folders

output_dir_name is the directory in which all the files will be placed. Make sure that it is empty
before running
